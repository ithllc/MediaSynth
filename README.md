Content / Media Synth

Overview

Creators, executives, and community leaders capture endless photos, clips, and documents during event-heavy weeks—but rarely turn them into content. Posts are delayed, inconsistent, or shallow. The backlog grows, and the narrative is lost.

Content / Media Synth is a local-first content strategist agent built on Gemini CLI + MCP. It transforms a chaotic week of media into polished, platform-ready posts in the user’s own voice.

Features
	•	Local-first: Reads directly from a user’s hard drive (photos, PDFs, notes) with privacy by default.

	•	Smart curation: Recommends the right photos, cross-references downloaded reports, and selects safe images.
	•	POV generation: Produces LinkedIn longform and X/Warpcast variants that emphasize thought leadership over fluff.
