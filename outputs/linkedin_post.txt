What an incredible day at the Google Gemini CLI Hackathon in NYC on September 6th! ðŸš€ It was inspiring to see so many brilliant minds come together, fueled by innovation and a shared passion for AI. 

From intense brainstorming sessions on the whiteboard, tackling ideas like 'Receipt organizer' and 'Discord-type Mod Manager', to deep collaborative work sessions around the table, the energy was palpable. Fuelled by pizza and great company, our teams dove into developing solutions, showcasing the power of focused teamwork.

Moments like these, filled with "Joy/Happiness/Enthusiasm" and "Focused and engaged" collaboration, are what drive progress in the AI space. Huge thanks to AI TINKERERS and betaworks for hosting such a fantastic event!
