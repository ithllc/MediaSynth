  "image_to_post": "A vibrant, well-lit photograph captures two individuals, a man and a woman, standing in front of a large projection screen at what appears to be a tech event or hackathon. The man, positioned slightly forward and to the left, is fair-skinned with light hair and a beard, wearing a multi-colored striped long-sleeved shirt and blue jeans. He holds a microphone and is smiling broadly, looking directly at the viewer. Behind him and to his right stands a woman with dark hair, wearing glasses and a maroon dress. She is also smiling warmly, looking towards the viewer. The screen behind them displays text, partially visible, including 'Google Gemini CLI Hackathon', 'September 6th', 'Cloud', 'AI TINKERERS', and 'betaworks'. The setting suggests an indoor venue with a modern, possibly industrial, aesthetic, featuring clear acrylic podiums and tables in the background."
